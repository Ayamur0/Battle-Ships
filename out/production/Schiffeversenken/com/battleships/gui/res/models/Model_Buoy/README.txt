# Summary

This is a model buoy to be used with RC model boating. 

Green or red ABS filament is used, so no painting is needed. Transparent ABS is used for the lamp lens.

Number stickers are applied and a clear coat is sprayed on to protect the numbers.

The light stand is glued to the superstructure using CA glue. The body is attached to the bottom bell and sealed with silicone caulk. The buoy is stabilized with a lead fishing weight of 2-4 oz. which is attached with a wire (I used Stainless Steel fishing leader wire) to the anchor extension.

Transparent filament is used for the lens on the light. Two 5-mm LEDs are stacked on each other and placed under the transparent, printed lens. Wires run through a conduit built into one of the supports of the buoy superstructure. The LEDs flash by using a printed circuit board with a couple of transistors, capacitors and a few resisters.
